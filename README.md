# Cats&Dogs Classification

This project focuses on the classification of images as either cats or dogs using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook file named "cats_and_dogs.ipynb" for the implementation.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries and frameworks are required to run the project:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- tqdm
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Torch

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the "cats_and_dogs.ipynb" file.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment.

3. Ensure that the necessary prerequisite libraries are installed.

4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code.
  
## Usage

The notebook provides step-by-step instructions for classifying images of cats and dogs. It includes the following sections:

1. Importing the required libraries and dependencies.

2. Mounting Google Drive to access the dataset.

3. Setting the paths for the training and testing data.

4. Defining a function to display images.

5. Displaying the original images from the training set.

6. Implementing the image classification model.

7. Training the model and evaluating its performance.

8. Making predictions on test images.

9. Visualizing the predictions.

## Results

The project aims to classify images as either cats or dogs. The results include the following:

- Accuracy and loss metrics during model training.

- Predictions and visualizations for test images.
